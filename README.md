This is a [middleware](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/handlers-and-middleware.html#middleware) for Guzzle 7 that leaves [Sentry breadcrumbs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) for all requests.

:warning: Please make sure you don't log sensitive information to Sentry and properly configure this middleware to redact secrets. :warning:

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require swisnl/guzzle-sentry-breadcrumbs-middleware
```

## Usage

``` php
use GuzzleHttp\Client as Guzzle;
use GuzzleHttp\HandlerStack;
use Swis\Guzzle\Sentry\BreadcrumbMiddleware;

$stack = HandlerStack::create();
$stack->push(new BreadcrumbMiddleware());
$client = new Guzzle(['handler' => $stack]);
```

Now when you send a request, a Sentry breadcrumb is logged with the following metadata:

* method
* uri
* status code
* response body (summary), in case of client or server exceptions (status code >= 400)
* duration

## Config

You can configure the middleware using the constructor arguments:

### `$category`
The category of the breadcrumb.

### `$message`
The message of the breadcrumb.

### `$redactedStrings`
A list of secret strings, such as API keys, that should be filtered out of the metadata.

### `$truncateBodyAt`
The length of the response body summary, which is added to the breadcrumb in case of client or server exceptions. Use null to disable logging response/request body.

By default, it does not log the request body and only logs the response body in case of client or server exceptions (status code >= 400). If you'd like to change this behaviour, you can provide your own `GuzzleHttp\BodySummarizerInterface` implementation. You can use the default `GuzzleHttp\BodySummarizer` for example, to log all request and response bodies. Please be aware not to log sensitive information!
